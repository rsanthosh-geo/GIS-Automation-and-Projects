Problem Statement

• Manual BNG spatial assessment is time consuming, requiring analysts to interpret site specific biodiversity features using multiple environmental datasets.
• Sites across district follow distinct priority hierarchies, demanding regionally customized workflows.
• Habitat assignment for BNG features demands manual overlay, interpretation, and verification of complex datasets (e.g., Ancient Woodland Inventory, Priority Habitat, Wood Pasture).
• The process is prone to human error, especially in large or rural sites with overlapping features from various habitat layers.
• Manual workflow lacks scalability, limiting the number of projects processed per resource and slowing delivery timelines.


Proposed Solution and business Impact

Key Innovations & Impact
Unmatched Speed & Scale:
Processed over 1 million hectares in under 9 minutes over 80% faster than manual methods, which take 20 minutes per hectare reducing site-level time to just 4–5 minutes. 
Accurate & Compliant Outputs:
Successfully labeled over 50,000 BNG habitat features with strict adherence to habitat dictionaries.
Enables delivery of more sites per analyst, enhancing project capacity without increasing headcount
