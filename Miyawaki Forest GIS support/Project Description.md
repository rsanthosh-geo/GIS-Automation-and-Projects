This project delivers a GIS- and remote sensing–driven framework to support urban Miyawaki forest development 
by identifying, classifying, and optimizing underutilized urban spaces for high-impact ecological restoration. 
Through a combination of satellite-based land cover extraction and smart spatial analytics in QGIS, 
the work enables actionable planning for urban greening initiatives.

The workflow includes the classification of urban land cover types—such as built-up areas, barren land, vegetation, 
and impervious surfaces—and the derivation of smart geospatial attributes like canopy potential, solar exposure, and soil-water proximity. 
These parameters directly inform the site selection, plantation design, and success rate of Miyawaki forest plantations.

Key deliverables include:

High-resolution land cover maps and geospatial layers for micro-habitat identification

Smart attribute layers optimized for plantation survival and growth

GIS-ready shapefiles for integration into city planning and climate resilience strategies

This project supports data-driven urban forestry, improves climate resilience, and promotes urban biodiversity enhancement 
by transforming degraded or overlooked urban areas into thriving green ecosystems using the Miyawaki methodology.
