# GIS-Automation-and-Projects
QGIS automation models and GIS project workflows with problem solving insights.

# GIS Automation & Remote Sensing Projects 🛰️

Welcome to my professional portfolio of GIS models and real-world project workflows. This repository contains automation models built in QGIS and problem-driven GIS project solutions focusing on habitat mapping, tree health management, and cloud polygon image processing.

## 📁 Structure

- `models/`: Custom QGIS models for automated image downloading and cloud masking
- `projects/`: GIS project documentation with problems tackled, workflows used, and results
- Each folder includes a `model_description.md` or `report.md` with all technical details

## 🔍 Included Projects & Models

### 🌿 BNG Habitat Automation
Automates the classification of habitats using QGIS models based on SOP and code tables.

### 🌳 Tree Hazard Management
Interpretation of tree health using satellite imagery and QC insights.

### ☁️ Cloud Polygon Image Download
QGIS model to auto-download and process cloud-covered imagery areas.

### 📏 Span Level Image Download
Buffered span-level QGIS model to automate high-resolution image extraction.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- QGIS
- Python (PyQGIS, GeoPandas)
- PostGIS
- High-res Satellite Imagery (30cm, GSAT)
