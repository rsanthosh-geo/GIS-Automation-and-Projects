# GIS Automation & Remote Sensing Projects 🛰️

Welcome to my professional portfolio of GIS models and real-world project workflows. This repository contains automation models built in QGIS and problem-driven GIS project solutions focusing on habitat mapping, tree health management, and cloud polygon image processing.

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

I specialize in:

- 🚀 **QGIS Model Builder Automation**: Custom-built models to eliminate repetitive tasks and reduce human error.
- 🛰️ **Remote Sensing-Based Image Processing**: Automating downloads, buffering, and filtering of satellite images.
- 🌿 **Ecological Mapping & Habitat Classification**: Generating AI-ready datasets with consistent attribution logic using SOP + code tables.
- 🌳 **Tree Health & Hazard Analysis**: Detecting vegetation threats using multi-angle satellite images with QC/QA insights.
- 🗂️ **PostGIS-Backed Workflows**: Efficient spatial database management for large-scale, multi-layer GIS operations.


## 📁 Structure

- `models/`: Custom QGIS models for automated image downloading and cloud masking
- `projects/`: GIS project documentation with problems tackled, workflows used, and results
- Each folder includes a `model_description.md` or `report.md` with all technical details
