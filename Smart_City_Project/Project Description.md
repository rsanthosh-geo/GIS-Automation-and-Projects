This project delivers a unified GIS and remote sensing–based spatial framework for managing and rejuvenating urban lakes within the Coimbatore Smart City Mission. Through the extraction and mapping of lakes, invasive species, islands, and surrounding urban features, it enables ecologically-informed interventions and long-term smart monitoring.

Utilizing a hybrid methodology combining manual digitization and AI-powered segmentation (SAM - Segment Anything Model), high-resolution spatial datasets were generated in QGIS. These outputs are enriched with smart attributes such as catchment classification, biodiversity zones, perimeter metrics, and recreational tagging — forming a foundational geospatial dataset for ecological planning, AI training, and public infrastructure design.
