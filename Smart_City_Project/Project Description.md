This project establishes a unified, GIS-driven spatial framework to support smart lake ecosystem management by integrating ecological, infrastructural, 
and urban data layers across lake catchments. 
Leveraging both manual digitization and AI-based segmentation (SAM - Segment Anything Model), the work delivers high-resolution 
geospatial layers representing waterbodies, invasive vegetation, islands, transmission lines, and urban land cover zones.

The initiative enables data-driven decision-making for lake rejuvenation, flood mitigation, habitat restoration, and biodiversity monitoring. 
Custom smart attribute models were developed to quantify ecological, recreational, and infrastructural parameters, guiding prioritization for ecological interventions.

Key highlights:

Developed a comprehensive geospatial dataset in QGIS, streamlining spatial governance for lake systems.

Used SAM to enhance accuracy and speed in mapping complex land-water interfaces and anthropogenic impacts.

Supported restoration planning across multiple lakes.

Facilitated biodiversity assessments and public-space planning through spatial mapping of key faunal habitats.

This project serves as a replicable spatial intelligence blueprint for urban lake management, combining remote sensing, GIS modeling,
and AI-driven feature extraction for sustainable ecological outcomes.
