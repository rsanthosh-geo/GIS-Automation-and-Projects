Production Process Overview

Key Challenges Identified:

Image Overlap: Inconsistent visual indicators across overlapping images affected interpretation accuracy.

Angle Variations: Differences in viewing angles led to contradictory assessments of object status.

Image Shift: Misalignment between overlapping datasets resulted in spatial discrepancies during feature marking.

Cloud Cover: Visibility was limited in certain areas due to cloud obstruction.

RGB Band Misinterpretation: Variations in grey phase interpretation occasionally led to misclassification of non-target features.

Quality Review Observations
Potential Sources of Error:

Overprediction: Non-target features such as shadows and healthy instances were occasionally misidentified.

Color-Based Misclassification: Non-green features (e.g., reddish brown, grey) were incorrectly categorized.

Vegetation Confusion: Nontree vegetation such as canopy or bushes was sometimes marked inaccurately.

Missed Features: Some less prominent instances were not identified during review.

Grey Color Confusion: Instances with a natural grey appearance were occasionally misclassified.

Polygon Precision: Smaller features led to generalized markings that sometimes included adjacent non-target areas.

Conclusion
This initial method offered valuable insights but encountered several challenges, including overlapping datasets, angle inconsistencies, environmental obstructions, and visual interpretation limitations. These observations emphasize the importance of methodological refinement and potential integration of complementary datasets to improve classification reliability.
