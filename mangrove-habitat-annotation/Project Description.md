This project delivers a foundational training dataset for AI-based mangrove classification by leveraging advanced GIS and remote sensing workflows. 
Centered on the manual annotation of mangrove habitats using high-resolution satellite imagery in QGIS, 
the dataset captures ecologically significant features with high spatial accuracy.

To enhance model generalization and reduce false positives, additional coastal habitat types such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, and saltmarshes within the same regions were also digitized. 
Their inclusion provides critical negative samples and contextual clarity, enabling better class distinction during model training and fine-tuning.


the project outputs include:

QA-verified shapefiles and class-labeled rasters

Structured for seamless integration into supervised machine learning pipelines

Aligned with ecological SOPs and field-informed class definitions

By combining domain expertise, spatial precision, and spectral analysis, this dataset supports the development of scalable, 
AI-powered habitat monitoring systemsâ€”laying the groundwork for robust, automated mangrove detection across diverse coastal environments.
