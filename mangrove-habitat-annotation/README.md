# Mangrove & Coastal Habitat Annotation using QGIS

This project focuses on the manual delineation and high-accuracy digitization of coastal habitats — specifically **mangroves**, **coral reefs**, **seagrass**, and **saltmarsh** — using satellite imagery in QGIS. The datasets and workflows are designed for ecological accuracy and scalability for machine learning (ML) and AI-based habitat monitoring systems.
