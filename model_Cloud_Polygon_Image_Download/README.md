Step-by-Step Guide:
1.	Set the Projection of the OS Base Map
o	Before running the model, confirm the projection is accurately set for the OS base map to align with cloud polygon data.
2.	Import Cloud Polygon File
o	Load the file containing the cloud polygons to prepare for image download.
3.	Open OS_Cloud_Polygon_Img_Download Model
o	Launch the automated model specifically created for downloading cloud polygon images.
4.	Select Field Parameters
o	Assign the cloud polygon shapefile layer to the designated field parameters within the model.
5.	Re-confirm Projection Settings
o	Verify that the projection settings match the OS base map specifications to prevent misalignment.

6.	Execute the Model
o	Run the model to initiate the automated download process.
